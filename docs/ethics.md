# Ethical Constraints

This document defines ethical and usage constraints
for the IIS (Information and Measurement System).

## Non-medical usage
- IIS is not a medical, psychological, or neurological tool.
- The system must not be used for diagnosis,
  treatment decisions, or health-related recommendations.
- Any interpretation implying medical causality is prohibited.

## Non-invasive assumption
- The IIS model assumes non-invasive data sources.
- The system does not require and must not justify
  invasive or implant-based data collection.

## Age-related constraints
- IIS must not be applied in contexts involving
  invasive or semi-invasive interventions
  for individuals under approximately 25 years of age.

This constraint is based on system-level considerations:
- Complex regulatory systems may continue structural
  and functional development over extended periods.
- Interventions during ongoing development
  may increase the risk of unintended effects.

IIS does not assess biological readiness
and must not be used to justify interventions
in developing systems.

## Predictive limitations
- IIS must not be used to predict individual outcomes.
- The system must not be used for labeling,
  classification, or ranking of individuals.

## Responsibility
- Responsibility for data collection and interpretation
  lies entirely outside the IIS model.
- IIS provides an analytical index only
  and does not make decisions.
