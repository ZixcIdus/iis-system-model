# Limitations

## General limitations
- IIS is not a medical, psychological, or neurological diagnostic system.
- The model does not describe internal biological mechanisms.
- No empirical or clinical validation is performed.
- Output values are relative and context-dependent.
- The model is sensitive to input normalization quality.

## Data limitations
- IIS does not define how inputs are measured.
- Input parameters are assumed to be indirect proxies.
- Measurement noise and bias are not explicitly modeled.

## Temporal limitations
- The base model does not include temporal dynamics.
- Longitudinal interpretation requires external analysis layers.

## Age-related limitations
- The IIS model must not be applied in contexts involving
  invasive or semi-invasive interventions for individuals
  under approximately 25 years of age.

This limitation is based on the following considerations:
- Functional and structural maturation of higher-order
  regulatory systems occurs over extended developmental periods.
- Introducing invasive interactions during ongoing development
  may increase risk of unintended system-level effects.

The IIS does not assess biological readiness
and must not be used to justify interventions in developing systems.

## Ethical and usage limitations
- IIS must not be used to justify medical or health-related decisions.
- The model must not be used for predictive claims
  regarding mental or neurological conditions.
- Any interpretation implying causality is explicitly prohibited.
